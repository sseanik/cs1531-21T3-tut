# Tutorial 07

## A. Pythonic

Modify [fettucine.py](fettucine.py) to improve it in terms of its adherence to pythonic principles.

## B. Requirements

Your tutor may break you up into groups to complete this activity.

* Q. What are attributes of good requirements?
* Q. How could we clean this up into well described requirements? "I want a burger with lots of pickles and mayo but I need to make sure that the mayo doesn't make the burger bun really wet. Oh, and it needs to be warm, like, made less than 5 minutes ago warm but not so hot that I burn myself. I'm also not a big fan of plastic containers so if it could be in a paper bag that would be good. Actually, make that a brown paper bag, I like the colour of that"

## C. User Stories

Consider the core requirements of UNSW Streams:

1. Ability to login, register if not registered, and log out
2. Ability to see a list of channels
3. Ability to create a channel, join a channel, invite someone else to a channel, and leave a channel
4. Within a channel, ability to view all messages, view the members of the channel, and the details of the channel
5. Within a channel, ability to send a message now, or to send a message at a specified time in the future
6. Within a channel, ability to edit, share between channels, remove, pin, unpin, react, or unreact to a message
7. Ability to view anyone's user profile, and modify a user's own profile (name, email, handle, and profile photo)
8. Ability to search for messages based on a search string
9. Ability to modify a user's admin permissions: (MEMBER, OWNER)
10. Ability to send message directly to a user (or group of users) via direct messaging (DM).

Pick **two** of the above and write a series of user stories that encompass each requirement:

* Discuss as a class the potential target audience, and use this as your type of user;
* Write acceptance criteria for each story and discuss when to use Scenario-based and Rule-based acceptance criteria

## D. Use Cases

Pick **one** of the above requirements you have written stories for and write a use case for the flow of interaction.

## E. Design Principles

A simple piece of code [box.py](box.py) that generates an ASCII box has been provided. What are possible code smells with this code? How would you refactor it to be more consistent with basic software engineering design principles?
